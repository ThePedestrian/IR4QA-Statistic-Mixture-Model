I can't walk properly because my foot starts to curl up, as well as my hand. I can't talk properly either and the side of my face feels as if it's drooping/being pulled downwards. This lasts only for about 5-10 seconds and always happens whenever I get up from sitting/laying down, or when I'm crossing the street. However, it can occur at any time, even just from standing for a bit, and I tend to know/feel when it's going to come. My mother said she had the same thing during her pregnancy and said it could be a stroke. I went to the hospital twice for this, but all they prescribed to me were steroids that didn't even help it at all. What is happening to me?? Why hasn't it gone away already?\",\n",

      "Has anyone here had any strange experiences similar to mine? My grandmother died unexpectedly six years ago. She had been in the hospital for over a month, but no one in the family expected her to die. However, one night shortly before her death, I fell asleep on the sofa at my mom's house. My mom had an old black and white baby picture of my grandmother hanging on the living room wall. When I woke up from my nap, I looked at the picture. It seemed strangely ALIVE! I'm not saying that the face in the picture moved or talked, but it just somehow seemed more alive than usual. I thought it was strange, and I was disturbed by it. Even though no one really thought my grandmother was going to die, I think that somehow deep inside I knew it was coming, but I didn't want to face it. What do you think?\n",

He saw a phone was on a stand next to the bathtub so he picked it up & dialed. He explained to the EMT operator what the situation was & that he didn't know where he was, what he took, or why he was really calling. She advised him to get out of the tub.

      "\n",
      "Cleaning Solutions: A mild liquid antimicrobial/germicidal medicated soap such as Provon or Satin, and water.  Inferior alternatives include products such as Almay Clearly Natural, Hypocare, Dial; or other mild, fragrance and color free-liquid antibacterial soap.  These should possibly be diluted with distilled or bottled water, depending on product strength.  In addition, mild non-iodized (no iodine) sea salt soaks as described below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cleaning Instructions\n",
      "\n",
      "     Body Piercings need to be cleaned once or twice daily, every day, for the entire initial healing time.  Most people clean morning and/or night in the shower.  Do not clean with your liquid soap product more than twice a day as this can irritate your piercing and possibly delay your healing.  For once-a-day cleanings, do it at the end of your day.  Optimal frequency will depend on your skin sensitivity, activity level, and environmental factors.\n",
      "     Before cleanings wash hands with liquid antibacterial soap and hot water.  If you wish, you may wear disposable latex or vinyl gloves, and/or use a hand sanitizing gel.  Never, never touch healing Piercings with dirty hands.  This is vital for avoiding infections.\n",
      "     Prepare the area for cleansing by rinsing or soaking the area with warm water and be sure to remove any stubborn crust using a cotton swab and warm water, never pick with fingernails.  This step is very important for your comfort.\n",
      "     Apply a small handful of cleaning solution to the area with your clean hand.  Cleanse the area and the jewelry, and gently rotate the jewelry back and forth a few times to work the solution to the inside of the piercing.  (You do not need to rotate your jewelry during the first several cleanings)  Allow the solution to cleanse there for a minute or so.  You may bathe normally but don’t purposely work anything other than the cleanser on or inside of the piercing.\n",
      "     Rinse the area thoroughly under running water, while rotating the jewelry back and forth to completely remove cleanser residue from the inside and the outside of the piercing.\n",
      "     Gently pat dry with disposable paper products such as gauze or tissues, as cloth towels can harbor bacteria.  Please try to be patient, each body is unique, and healing times can vary considerably.  If your piercing is tender or secreting you should continue the care regimen even if it is past the stated average healing time range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salt Water Soaks\n",
      "\n",
      "After cleaning your piercing you can perform your non-iodized sea salt soaks either in or out of the shower.  First fill a fresh disposable cup with approximately 8 ounces of warm water and add a ¼ teaspoon of non-iodized sea salt, stirring until it is dissolved.  When ready, either place the cup over the piercing-forming a vacuum-type-seal-or dip the piercing into the cup.  If either of these techniques are not possible, pre-soak a fresh tissue, paper towel, or gauze pad in the sea salt solution and firmly press it on your piercing.  In order to promote effectiveness, the first sea salt soak should last at least 10 minutes.  All additional soaks should last at least 5-10 minutes.  Following the sea salt soak, pat your piercing dry with a fresh disposable paper or gauze product\n",
